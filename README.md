# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game developed to practice and polish my skills in web development. The game allows a user to play the classic Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer opponent. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This game allows players to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer makes a random choice. The result of each round (Win, Lose, or Draw) is displayed, and scores are tracked for both the player and the computer. The design is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience.
